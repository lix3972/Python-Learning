torchvision.datasets.FashionMNIST(root, train=True, transform=None, target_transform=None, download=False)

    Fashion-MNIST Dataset.

    Parameters

            root (string) – Root directory of dataset where Fashion-MNIST/processed/training.pt and Fashion-MNIST/processed/test.pt exist.

            train (bool, optional) – If True, creates dataset from training.pt, otherwise from test.pt.

            download (bool, optional) – If true, downloads the dataset from the internet and puts it in root directory. If dataset is already downloaded, it is not downloaded again.

            transform (callable, optional) – A function/transform that takes in an PIL image and returns a transformed version. E.g, transforms.RandomCrop

            target_transform (callable, optional) – A function/transform that takes in the target and transforms it.

参数transform是输入数据(图片)的变换，target_transform可以理解为真值的变换。
